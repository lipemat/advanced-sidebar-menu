== Description ==

Uses the parent/child relationship of your pages or categories to generate menus based on the current section of your site. Assign a page or category to a parent and this will do the rest for you.

Keeps the menu clean and usable. Only related items display so you don't have to worry about keeping a custom menu up to date or displaying links to items that don't belong.

= How do I change the styling of the current page? =

You may add css to your theme's style.css to change the way the menu looks

For Instance This would remove the dot and  change the color
<code>
.advanced-sidebar-menu li.current_page_item a {
    color: black;
}

.advanced-sidebar-menu li.current_page_item {
    list-style-type:  none !important;
}
</code>

= How do you get the categories to display on single post pages? =

There is a checkbox in the widget options that will display the same structure for the categories the post is in.

= How do you edit the output or built in css? =

Create a folder in your child theme named "advanced-sidebar-menu" copy any of the files from the "views" folder into
the folder you just created. You may edit the files to change the output or css. You must have the option checked to use the built in CSS (in the widget) to be able to edit the css file in this way.


= Does the menu change for each page you are on? =

Yes. Based on whatever page, post, or category you are on, the menu will change automatically to display the current parents and children.
