== Description ==

Uses the parent/child relationship of your pages or categories to generate menus based on the current section of your site. Simply assign a page or category to a parent and this will do the rest for you.

Keeps the menu clean and usable. Only related items display so you don't have to worry about keeping a custom menu up to date or displaying links to items that don't belong.

= What text domain do I use for translation and where is the .pot file? =

The .pot file may be found in the plugins' languages folder. Use the 'advanced-sidebar-menu' text domain.


= How do I change the styling of the current page? =

You may add css to your theme's style.css to change the way the menu looks

For Instance This would remove the dot and  change the color
<code>
.advanced-sidebar-menu li.current_page_item a {
    color: black;
}

.advanced-sidebar-menu li.current_page_item {
    list-style-type:  none !important;
}
</code>


= How do you get the categories to display on single post pages? =

There is a checkbox in the widget options that will display the same structure for the categories the post is in.

= How do you edit the output or built in css? =

Create a folder in your child theme named "advanced-sidebar-menu" copy any of the files from the "views" folder into
the folder you just created. You may edit the files at will to change the output or css.
You must have the option checked to use the built in CSS (in the widget) to be able to edit the css file in this way.


= Does the menu change for each page you are on? =

Yes. Based on whatever page you are on, the menu will change automatically to display the current parents and children.

= How does this work with styling the page? =

This will automatically generate class names for each level for menu system.
You can add classes to your theme's style.css file to style it accordingly. 
You may want to use something like margins to set the levels apart.
